        <h2>Importance of Goal 11:</h2>
        <p>Urbanization is inevitable, but if cities continue to develop in unsustainable ways, they will become breeding grounds for inequality, pollution, and social unrest. Sustainable urban planning is not just about buildings or infrastructure; it's about creating cities that are inclusive, environmentally responsible, and resilient to shocks. Prioritizing sustainability in cities is not optional—it's a necessity if we want to avoid environmental collapse and societal breakdown.</p>
